It is challenging coming up with additional test cases as it is a bit unclear what feature is under test.  There are several areas or features that appear to be under test.
  1. Search functionality - Ensuring the search bar is working and returning relevant results 
  2. Quantity of items - Ensuring multiple items can be added to the cart
  3. Search category/department functionality - ensuring all or specific departments are selectable and working as intended.
  4. Compare feature - ensuring similar are displayed when using the compare with similar items feature.
